   * This class will calculate the ambient light color emitted by the sky.

   * As in the real world, the color of the ambient light changes depending on the daytime in the
   * original game.  To archive this effect, the game uses a list of so called `SkyState`s, which
   * describe the look of the sky at a single fixed point in time.  During the day/night cycle, the
   * game then interpolates between two of those `SkyState`s, the one closest *before* the current
   * time, and the closest next one.  The interpolated color is then applied as ambient lighting and
   * fog color.
   *
   * Fog will also be calculated by this class, since it's parameters are embedded inside the
   * `SkyState`s as well.
   *
   * Since sky rendering is a pretty complex topic in the original game, this class contains a lot of
   * magic numbers of which we are not quite sure why many of them were chosen.  Probably only
   * because it looked good.
